# SBOM Benchmark Projects

This repository contains benchmark projects for testing Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation tools. The benchmarks include scenarios with both vulnerable dependencies and false positives.

## Vulnerable Dependency Benchmark

This project specifically focuses on simulating a scenario related to the identification of the log4j vulnerable dependenciey (CVE-2021-44228). The project contains a single Java class which demonstrates basic logging functionality using the Log4j library. The class initializes a logger instance and logs error and fatal messages.


## False Positive Benchmark

The fp1 project intentionally creates a scenario where a false positive is generated by an SBOM generation tool, simulating the incorrect identification of a vulnerable dependency (CVE-2022-45688).

The Main class in this benchmark project does not have any actual dependencies or interactions with external libraries that could introduce vulnerabilities. It simply creates a JSON object using the JSONObject class from the org.json.XML library and prints its string representation.

However, an SBOM generation tool might erroneously identify the presence of the org.json library as a potential vulnerability, leading to a false positive result.
